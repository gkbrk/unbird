unbird
======

Utility to turn Bird-style Literate Programming documents into code.

1. Usage

  The code takes input from a file or from standard input, and outputs the code
  to standard output. It can be used as follows.

  unbird test.py.bird > test.py

  cat test.py.bird | unbird > test.py

2. Building

  The program can be built with the included Makefile. The default rule should
  create an executable `./bin/unbird`.

3. Testing

  There's currently no automated testing available, but there are some example
  files included with the source code. You can run the command below and see if
  the result looks reasonable.

  find test/ -type f -exec printf "-- %s \n\n" {} \; -exec ./bin/unbird {} \;
