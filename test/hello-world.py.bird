This is a test file to show how to print "Hello World" in the Python
programming language.

The first way we'll do this is by hardcoding the string.

> print("Hello, World!")

But as you can see, this will not scale. It is much better to write a method
that can handle greeting different entities.

> def greet(name="World"):
>   print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>
> greet() # Prints Hello, World!
> greet("Leo") # Prints Hello, Leo!
